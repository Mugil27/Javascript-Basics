# Online Resume 

Build four JavaScript objects, each one representing a different resume section. The objects includes property names and the data types of their values.All properties should be included and contain a value of the type specified unless the property is marked 'optional'. Property values may contain real or fake data.

The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information.

#  What I will Learn from this project:
* Javascript syntax
* manipulating data types (like JSON)
* Javascript Objects
* building loops
* creating functions
* jQuery DOM manipulation methods

# Files Included:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This file is empty. You should write your code here.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
